# Album-art-visualizer-for-Wallpaper-Engine
This web wallpaper uses your last.fm data to show you the current song that you are listening to.

#How does it work?
This wallpaper fetches your last.fm scrobbles information to show you the album cover art from the current song that is being played and your last 3 songs on a list.
You'll need a Last.fm API key to use this, you can get it here: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create

#Setup
1. Download files (index.html, style.css and script.js)
2. Keep them in a folder
3. Open script.js using VSCode or any IDE
4. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' and 'YOUR_USERNAME' with your actual last.fm API key and Username and save changes
5. Open up Wallpaper Engine and hit the 'Open Wallpaper' button, then 'Open offline wallpaper (animated)'
6. Search for the index.html file you just downloaded and load it up
7. Enjoy :)
